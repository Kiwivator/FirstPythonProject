# FirstPythonProject

My first attempt at making something in Python, an IRC bot for the #korean channel on Snoonet.

Initially start with tutorial at https://linuxacademy.com/blog/geek/creating-an-irc-bot-with-python3/ but changed multiple parts including the connection process to work with Snoonet which is slightly different to Freenode.

Basic functions from the first iteration of the bot are a Hi command, .tell command and Bye disconnect command.

The next step is to gradually add more functionality to the bot.

Since I'm new, any suggestions to improve code or fix bugs are welcome.
